# Bruno Pinto

I build Laravel packages and occasionally turn images into thousands of HTML elements for absolutely no reason.

## Stuff I've Made

- **[Vector](https://github.com/brunoabpinto/vector)** → Use Vue in Blade without the ceremony
- **[csrf-refresh](https://github.com/brunoabpinto/csrf-refresh)** → Fix Livewire's session expiration 419s
- **[IMGML](https://github.com/brunoabpinto/imgml)** → Images as HTML. Don't ask why.

## Things I Write About

Security holes I've discovered, packages I've built, and experiments that probably shouldn't work but do.
